                <p><h4>Alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</h4> or External dispute resolution (EDR), 
                    typically denotes a wide range of dispute resolution processes and techniques that 
                    parties can use to settle disputes with the help of a third party. They are used for 
                    disagreeing parties who cannot come to an agreement short of litigation. However, 
                    ADR is also increasingly being adopted as a tool to help settle disputes within the court system.
                </p>

                <p>Despite historic resistance to ADR by many popular parties and their advocates, 
                    ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession
                     in recent[when?] years. In 2008, some courts required some parties to resort to ADR
                      of some type like mediation, before permitting the parties' cases to be tried (the European
                       Mediation Directive (2008) expressly contemplates so-called "compulsory" mediation. This means
                        that attendance is compulsory, not that settlement must be reached through mediation). Additionally, parties to merger and
                     acquisition transactions are increasingly turning to ADR to resolve post-acquisition disputes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts,
                         the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality,
                          and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or
                           individuals who will decide their dispute. Some of the senior judiciary in certain 
                           jurisdictions (of which England and Wales is one) are strongly in favour of this use
                            of mediation to settle disputes. Since the 1990s many American courts have also increasingly
                             advocated for the use of ADR to settle disputes. However, it is not clear as to whether litigants 
                            can properly identify 
                        and then use the ADR programmes available to them, thereby potentially limiting their effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <h4>There are four general classes of ADR:</h4> Negotiation, Mediation, Collaborative law, and Arbitration.
                     Some academics include Conciliation as a fifth category, but others include this within the definition of
                      mediation.
                    <p>
                        <h4>Negotiation</h4> is a dialogue between two or more parties to resolve points of difference,
                         gain an advantage for an individual or collective, or craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. 
                         The parties aspire to agree on matters of mutual interest. The agreement can be beneficial for all
                          or some of the parties involved. The negotiators should establish their own needs and wants while 
                          also seeking to understand the wants and needs of others involved to increase their chances of
                           closing deals, avoiding conflicts, forming relationships with other parties, or maximizing mutual gains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Mediation</h4> is a structured, interactive process where an impartial third party neutrally
                         assists disputing parties in resolving conflict through the use of specialized communication and
                          negotiation techniques. All participants in mediation are encouraged to actively participate in
                           the process. Mediation is a "party-centered" process in that it is focused primarily upon the 
                           needs, rights, and interests of the parties. The mediator uses a wide variety of techniques to
                            guide the process in a constructive direction and to help the parties find their optimal solution.
                             A mediator is facilitative in that they manage the interaction between parties and facilitates
                              open communication. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Collaborative law</h4> also known as collaborative practice, divorce or family law, is a 
                        legal process enabling couples who have decided to separate or end their marriage to work with 
                        their collaborative professionals including collaboratively trained lawyers, coaches and financial 
                        professionals in order to avoid the uncertain outcome of court and to achieve a settlement that
                         best meets the specific needs of both parties and their children without the underlying threat
                          of litigation. The process allows parties to have a fair settlement. The voluntary process is
                           initiated when the couple signs a contract (a "participation agreement") binding each other
                            to the process and disqualifying their respective lawyer's right to represent either one in
                             any future family-related litigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Arbitration</h4> is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) that resolves disputes
                         outside the judiciary courts. The dispute will be decided by one or more persons (the 'arbitrators',
                          'arbiters' or 'arbitral tribunal'), which renders the 'arbitration award'. An arbitration decision
                           or award is legally binding on both sides and enforceable in the courts, unless all parties stipulate
                            that the arbitration process and decision are non-binding. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Arbitration is often used for the resolution of commercial disputes, particularly in the context of
                         international commercial transactions. In certain countries such as the United States, arbitration 
                         is also frequently employed in consumer and employment matters, where arbitration may be mandated by 
                         the terms of employment or commercial contracts and may include a waiver of the right to bring a
                          class action claim. Mandatory consumer and employment arbitration should be distinguished from 
                          consensual arbitration, particularly commercial arbitration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Conciliation</h4> is an alternative dispute revolution (ADR) process whereby the parties to 
                        a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties both separately and together in an attempt
                         to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communication,
                          interpreting issues, encouraging parties to explore potential solvents and assisting parties 
                          in finding a mutually acceptable outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conciliation differs from arbitration in that the conciliation process, in and of itself,
                         has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or 
                         call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a form of "conciliation" that is more akin to negotiation. A "conciliator" 
                        assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives 
                        (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then
                         has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. 
                         He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to "give" on the
                          objectives one at a time, starting with the least important and working toward the most
                           important for each party in turn. The parties rarely place the same priorities on all
                            objectives, and usually have some objectives that are not listed by the other party.
                             Thus the conciliator can quickly build a string of successes and help the parties 
                             create an atmosphere of trust which the conciliator can continue to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Other methods</h4>
                        <p>
                        </p>
                        Beyond the basic types of alternative dispute resolutions there are other different forms of ADR.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Case evaluation</h4>
                    <p>
                      Case evaluation is a non-binding process in which parties present the facts and the issues
                       to a neutral case evaluator who advises the parties on the strengths and weaknesses of their 
                       respective positions, and assesses how the dispute is likely to be decided by a jury or other
                        adjudicator.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Early neutral evaluation</h4>
                    <p>
Early neutral evaluation is a process that takes place soon after a case has been filed in court. The case is 
referred to an expert who is asked to provide a balanced and neutral evaluation of the dispute. The evaluation
 of the expert can assist the parties in assessing their case and may influence them towards a settlement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Family group conference
Family group conference is a meeting between members of a family and members of their extended related group. 
At this meeting (or often a series of meetings) the family becomes involved in learning 
skills for interaction and in making a plan to stop the abuse or other ill-treatment between its members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Neutral fact-finding
                      Edit
                      Neutral fact-finding is a process where a neutral third party, selected either by the disputing parties
                       or by the court, investigates an issue and reports or testifies in court. 
                      The neutral fact-finding process is particularly useful for resolving complex scientific and factual disputes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Expert determination
Expert determination is a procedure where a dispute or a difference between the parties is submitted,
 by mutual agreement of the parties, to one or more experts who make a determination on the matter referred 
to them. The determination is binding, unless the parties agreed otherwise and is a confidential procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p>

Suitable for multi-party disputes
Lower costs, in many cases it's free when involving consumers
Likelihood and speed of settlements
Flexibility of process
Parties' control of process
